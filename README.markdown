# Tissue

    A tissue is an ensemble of cells, not necessarily identical, but from the same origin, that together carry out a specific function.
Wikipedia about [Tissue](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_%28biology%29)

## Why?

By default, [cells](https://github.com/apotonick/cells) loads views only from `app/cells` inside your application. Tissue extends cells, loading views from `Rails::Engine`-spread `app/cells`.

## Instalation

Add `gem tissue` to your Gemfile. Done!
